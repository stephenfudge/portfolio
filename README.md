## Features

My portfolio includes the following features:

- **Homepage**: An introduction to myself and my skills.

- **Projects**: A showcase of my projects with screenshots, descriptions, and links to the live websites and GitHub repositories.

- **Skills**: A list of my technical skills.

- **Resume**: A PDF version of my resume.

- **Contact**: A contact form for visitors to get in touch with me.

## Design

The website design features a sleek and modern aesthetic, with a focus on showcasing the web developer's portfolio and skills. The color scheme is primarily black, white, and shades of grey, with pops of pink, purple and blue for added visual interest. The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, and includes a light and dark mode to enhance user experience.

## Testing

To ensure the quality and reliability of my portfolio website, I have created unit tests for each page and component. These tests cover various aspects such as functionality, rendering, and user interactions. By conducting thorough testing, I can confidently identify and address any issues or bugs that may arise.

Additionally, I tested the portfolio [here](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter) to ensure that the contrast between text and background was good for users who may be colorblind.
